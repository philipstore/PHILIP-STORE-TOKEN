# PHILIP-STORE-TOKEN
PHILIP STORE Token is a standard token ERC20, intended for purchase and sale of products and services through online platforms, like: Website, App, and other digital medias.
The token (STORE) has as its main objective to be functional in the real world, where it is already possible to buy products and services through ecommerce and application.
Expansion: The site plans to receive orders in crypto from any user without the need for KYC, carry out the intermediation of purchases (Drop Shipping), thus receiving the order in any crypto accepted by the PHILIP STORE platform and making the purchase with FIAT on the third party site, thus bridging the gap between a user who wants to pay with crypto and a site that does not accept crypto as payment.
